Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at the kitchen table, her back slumped, her hand still holding the pen that has just written and erased the word "forgive". She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The kitchen is bathed in the cool glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows across the wooden floors. The window is open, letting in the crisp autumn air and the sound of raindrops tapping on the window sill. The only other sound is the soft ticking of the old clock on the wall, counting down the seconds of the day
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
