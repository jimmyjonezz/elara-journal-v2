Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at a desk, her elbows resting on the table, her hands on the keyboard. Her back is slightly hunched, her shoulders tense. Her eyes are fixed on the screen, but her gaze is distant. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is small, with a single window letting in the fading light of a late autumn afternoon. The air is cool, carrying the scent of damp leaves and woodsmoke from a nearby fireplace. The only sound is the soft tapping of her fingers on the keyboard, punctuated by the occasional click of the mouse. The room is filled with the quiet dissonance of memories, the echoes of a past that refuses to remain in the past
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
