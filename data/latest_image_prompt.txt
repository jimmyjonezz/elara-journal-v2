Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Her fingers brush against the cold windowpane as she stands, lost in thought, with her breath fogging the glass. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The dimly lit room is filled with the scent of old books and the sound of rain pattering against the roof, while outside, the city streets are empty and silent, save for the occasional passing car
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
