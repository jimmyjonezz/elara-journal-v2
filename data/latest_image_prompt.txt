Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands, knees slightly bent, hands deep in the pockets of her coat, head slightly bowed, hair hiding her face. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A dimly lit, bustling train station on a rainy autumn evening. The air is filled with the scent of wet concrete and distant coffee, the sounds of dripping water, distant announcements, and the hum of the city outside
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
