Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands still, her fingers brushing against the cold wall, as her eyes scan the empty hallway. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The interior is dimly lit, with faint sounds of rain pattering against the windowpane, and the smell of old books wafting through the air, on a chilly winter morning
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
