Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands still, her breath visible in the cold air, with her hands tucked into her coat pockets. Setting: The scene is set in a quiet, snow-covered street on a winter morning, with the sound of distant traffic and the smell of wood smoke hanging in the air. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
