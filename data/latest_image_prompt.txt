Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands by the open window, one hand gripping the cold metal frame, the other absently scratching the cat's head as it weaves between her legs. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Early morning light filters through bare tree branches, casting shifting shadows across the cluttered kitchen table. The distant sound of traffic mingles with the sharp scent of wet pavement and the faint metallic tang of approaching rain
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
