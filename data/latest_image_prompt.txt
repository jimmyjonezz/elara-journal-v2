Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands still, her feet rooted to the spot, fingers clutching the strap of her bag. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The dimly lit subway station, the smell of wet wool and damp air filling her nostrils, the sound of murmured conversations and screeching trains in the distance
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
