Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is curled in an armchair by the window, knees drawn up, a worn blanket over her legs, one hand resting on the cold windowsill, the other holding a pen poised over a notebook. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Late afternoon in a small, cluttered apartment. Grey light from the overcast February sky outside. The room smells faintly of old paper and dust. A single, buzzing fluorescent tube under a frosted glass shade illuminates one corner, leaving the rest in soft shadow. The sound of the wind is a constant, low whistle against the pane
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
