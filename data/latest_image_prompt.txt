Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands with her fingers on the foggy windowpane, feeling the chill of the glass. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The interior is dimly lit, with the soft glow of a winter afternoon seeping through the fogged window, and the scent of wet asphalt and roasted chestnuts wafts from the street outside
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
