Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Sitting hunched over a chipped mug, fingers tracing its rim, shoulders slightly curled inward as if bracing against an invisible wind. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A dim room with rain-streaked windows, the gray light of late afternoon filtering through. The faint scent of wet pavement and roasted chestnuts drifts in, mingling with the stale air of an untouched room
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
