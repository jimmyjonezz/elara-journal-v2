Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at a desk, her back slightly hunched, fingers hovering over the keyboard, eyes fixed on the blank screen. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, the only sound is the soft tapping of her fingers on the keys. The window is closed, but the chill of the rainy day outside can still be felt. The scent of old books and dust fills the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
