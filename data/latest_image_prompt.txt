Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Elara sits at a small wooden table, her hands wrapped around a coffee mug, fingers tracing the rim. Her gaze is fixed on a old photograph, her lips slightly parted as if trying to form a forgotten smile. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The interior of a cozy, dimly lit cafe. Raindrops trickle down the fogged-up window, casting a soft glow on Elara's face. The scent of fresh coffee and damp earth fills the air. It's late afternoon on a gloomy autumn day

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
