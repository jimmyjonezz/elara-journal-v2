Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Elara sits at a small table near the window, her hands wrapped around a cup of coffee, fingers tracing the rim, eyes focused on the rain outside. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The interior of the café is dimly lit, with soft jazz playing in the background. It’s late afternoon in autumn, the sky outside a mix of grey and orange, reflecting on the wet streets

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
