Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at her desk, her hands folded on her lap, her head slightly bowed, her eyes closed. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The office is quiet, the only sound is the hum of the computers. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the room. The air is filled with the smell of coffee and the faint hum of distant traffic

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
