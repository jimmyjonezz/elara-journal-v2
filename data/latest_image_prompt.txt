Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at her kitchen table, elbows on the table, hands cupped around a mug of tea, gaze fixed on the rain outside the window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Interior, a small, cozy kitchen, the smell of wet earth and faintly, the taste of tea. The room is filled with the soft, rhythmic sound of rain tapping on the roof and windows. It's early morning, the light is gray and muted, like the sky outside. The air is cool, the kind that makes you want to huddle under a blanket
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
