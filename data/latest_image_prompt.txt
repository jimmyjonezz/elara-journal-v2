Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at the table, her hands wrapped around the tea cup, her fingers still trembling slightly, her eyes focused on the liquid inside. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, the only sound is the ticking of the old clock on the wall. It's a cold autumn day outside, the smell of rain and damp earth lingers in the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
