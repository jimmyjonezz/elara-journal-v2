Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits hunched over the table, her left hand hovering inches from the window frame, fingers slightly curled as if still reaching for the handle. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is bathed in the soft, golden light of the setting sun, casting long, dancing shadows through the half-open window. The air is crisp, carrying the faint scent of damp leaves and woodsmoke from the neighbors' fireplaces. The ancient clock on the wall ticks steadily, its hands inching towards seven
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
