Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Sitting at the kitchen table, elbows on the table, hands cupping a mug of tea, eyes looking out the window into the fading light. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A small, cozy kitchen, late afternoon in autumn, the smell of rain and old books fills the room, the sound of a ticking clock echoes quietly

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
