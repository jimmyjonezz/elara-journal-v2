Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Arms wrapped around knees, chin resting on them, eyes fixed on the blank page. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A small, dimly lit room with a single window, through which the rain softly taps against the glass. The scent of old books and dust fills the air, while the ticking of an antique clock marks the passage of time
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
