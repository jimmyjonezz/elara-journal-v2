Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at the kitchen table, elbows on the table, fingers interlaced, chin resting on them, gaze fixed on the window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The kitchen is dimly lit, the only sound the tapping of raindrops on the window and the hum of the old refrigerator. The air is cool and damp, carrying the scent of wet earth and distant smoke

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
