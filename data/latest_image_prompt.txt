Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands with her back against the wall, one hand on the chill surface, fingers spread. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The dimly lit corridor stretches out before her, lined with doors that seem to absorb the faint hum of the air conditioning, the scent of wet asphalt wafting in from outside on the winter breeze
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
