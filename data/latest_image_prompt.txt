Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits in the bathtub with her eyes closed, water up to her shoulders, and her hands resting on the edge. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The bathroom is dimly lit, with only a faint light coming from under the door, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the cold winter air, filled with the scent of old soap and worn wooden furniture
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
