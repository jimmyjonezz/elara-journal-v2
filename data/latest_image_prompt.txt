Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at the desk, shoulders slightly hunched, left hand wrapped around a pen, right hand resting on the keyboard, fingers tapping a silent rhythm. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, the only sound is the soft tapping of her fingers and the distant hum of the city outside. The window is open, letting in the cool autumn air, carrying with it the scent of rain and distant fires
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
