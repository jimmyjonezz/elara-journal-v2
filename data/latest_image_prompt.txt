Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at the table, her right hand outstretched towards the sunlight, fingers slightly curled as if trying to grasp something invisible. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A cozy, cluttered room with a large window letting in the morning sun. The scent of old books and coffee lingers in the air, mixing with the faint hum of the city outside. It's autumn, and the leaves from the tree outside the window dance in the breeze, casting flickering shadows on the wall
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
