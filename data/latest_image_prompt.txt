Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is curled in an armchair by the window, knees drawn up, a chipped mug balanced on her thigh, her gaze fixed on the frost-fern patterns on the glass. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A small, dim room in late afternoon. The only light is the weak, greyish-blue glow of a winter sky seeping through the window, catching dust motes. The air smells of old paper, cold stone, and the faint, sweet decay of a forgotten orange in a bowl. A distant siren wails, then fades
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
