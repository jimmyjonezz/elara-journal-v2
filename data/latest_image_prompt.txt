Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at a small, round table, her back hunched, hands wrapped around a cold coffee cup, as if trying to warm them. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A cozy, dimly lit caf√© on a chilly autumn afternoon. The scent of old books and fresh coffee fills the air, while outside, leaves dance in the rain

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
