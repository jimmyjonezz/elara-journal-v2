Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits on the floor, knees bent, arms wrapped around them, head resting on her knees, eyes closed. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit by the setting sun. The air is cool, carrying a faint scent of old books and a hint of distant rain. The only sound is the soft ticking of the clock on the wall, counting down the seconds to tomorrow
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
