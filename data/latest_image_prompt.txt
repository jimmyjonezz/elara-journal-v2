Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands by the window, her fingers tracing the chill of the glass as she gazes out into the grey day. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The interior is dimly lit, with only a sliver of winter sunlight peeking through the frosty windowpane, casting a pale glow on the empty room, filled with the scent of old books and the distant sound of wind whispering through the trees outside
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
