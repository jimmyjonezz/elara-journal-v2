Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at the kitchen table, elbows on the table, hands wrapped around a mug, head slightly bent, as if listening to a distant sound. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The kitchen is dimly lit, the only light coming from a small lamp on the table. The window is closed, but the sound of rain is still audible, tapping against the glass like fingertips on a keyboard. The air is cool, with a faint smell of old coffee and dust. It's late afternoon, the sky outside is overcast, the clouds moving slowly, as if carrying heavy secrets. The ticking of the clock on the wall is the only other sound in the room
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
