Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at her desk, her shoulders slightly hunched, her hands resting on the keyboard, fingers tapping nervously. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The room is dimly lit, the only light coming from the lamp on the desk. The air is cool, and the scent of rain is faintly noticeable through the closed window. It's late afternoon, and the sky outside is a mix of grey and purple, signaling the approach of autumn evening

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
