Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting on a bench, elbows on knees, hands clasped together, looking down at her entwined fingers. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The park is bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun, leaves crunching underfoot, the scent of damp earth and distant smoke from a chimney
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
