Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Sitting on the cold bathroom tiles, knees drawn to chest, left palm pressed against the humming washing machine, right hand suspended mid-air near the dripping tap. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Winter light filters through frosted glass, casting geometric shadows on stacked towels; the smell of damp linen mixes with metallic tang from rusty pipes, while droplets echo in the porcelain basin
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
