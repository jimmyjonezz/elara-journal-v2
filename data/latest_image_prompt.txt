Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slouched in a worn armchair, spine curved like a question mark, fingers tracing the chipped rim of a mug — right thumb rubbing obsessively at a rust stain. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Pre-dawn haze filters through frost-etched windows; shelves sag under the weight of cloth-bound books. A dented kettle whistles two rooms away, its sound muffled by layers of yellowed curtains and the persistent hum of a refrigerator
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
