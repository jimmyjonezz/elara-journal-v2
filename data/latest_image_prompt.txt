Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She grips the subway strap tightly, fingers slick with sudden sweat, eyelids drooping wearily as shoulders sag against the rhythmic jolt of the car. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Crowded late-November subway car rumbling through dim tunnels at evening rush, chill drafts carrying damp wool and coffee scents, pierced by fleeting spicy perfume
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
