Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She's kneeling by the window sill, spine curved like a question mark, one palm flat against the glass while the other absently picks at a loose thread on her wool sock. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Dusk bleeds into the room—faint smell of melted candle wax and dust. Outside, a streetlamp casts long shadows through swirling snow; inside, the record player’s orange glow pulses in time with the music’s dying notes
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
