Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands by the desk, one hand gripping the notebook's edge, fingers dusted gray, shoulders slightly slumped as breath fogs the chilly windowpane. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Cluttered corner of a dimly lit apartment study, late autumn afternoon with gray light seeping through rain-speckled glass; faint scent of damp leaves and stale ink, distant hum of city traffic below
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
