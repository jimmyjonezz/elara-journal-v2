Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at a small table by the window, her back hunched, fingers drumming lightly on the chipped mug. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: The interior is dimly lit, the air filled with the aroma of old books and bitter coffee. Rain taps softly against the window, casting a faint, dancing reflection on her face. It's a gray autumn afternoon, and the cafe is almost empty, save for the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the distant ticking of a clock

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
