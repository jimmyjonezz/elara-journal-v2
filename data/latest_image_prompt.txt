Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits with her back slightly arched, hands cradling the warm cup, eyes gazing out the window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, with soft morning light peeking through the blinds, casting a warm glow on the wooden floor, and the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
