Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits on the cold kitchen floor, back against the cabinets, holding a damp rag limply in her lap, shoulders rounded from the repetitive motion of cleaning. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Late afternoon light slants through a streaked window, illuminating dust motes and the wet trail on the wooden floor. The air smells of wet wool, lemon cleaner, and the faint, lingering scent of burnt sugar from earlier. A distant siren wails, then fades
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
