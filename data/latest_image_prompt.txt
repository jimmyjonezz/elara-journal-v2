Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slouched on a wooden chair, elbow propped on the windowsill, fingers tracing the frost patterns — thumb pressing too hard, as if testing the glass’s resilience. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Late afternoon in February; the room bathed in pallid, diffused light from snow-heavy clouds. Smell of dusty radiators and faint lavender from an unused sachet in the drawer. A distant hum of a refrigerator cycling on
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
