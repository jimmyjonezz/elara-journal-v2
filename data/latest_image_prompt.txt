Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits with her back slightly curved, one hand resting on the cold windowpane, fingers slightly curled as if holding an invisible pen. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Early evening light filters through the frost-edged window, casting pale blue shadows across the cluttered desk. The faint scent of cold tea lingers in the air, mixed with the distant hum of city traffic and the soft rustle of dry leaves scraping against the glass
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
