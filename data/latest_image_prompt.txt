Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slouched in the chair, arms wrapped around herself, head tilted to the side, eyes focused on something distant. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, a soft glow from the lamp on the desk. The window is open, letting in the cool autumn air, carrying with it the faint scent of wet leaves and the distant hum of the city. The clock on the wall ticks steadily, each second echoing the rhythm of her thoughts. A half-finished cup of coffee sits on the desk, its surface reflecting the flickering light
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
