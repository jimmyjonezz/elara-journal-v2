Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slouched against oak shelves, left knee bent with boot heel digging into the wood, thumb tracing a faded gilt title while index finger taps arrhythmically against her collarbone. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Frost-veined windows filter weak 3pm light onto uneven parquet; silence broken only by the hiss of steam pipes and the creak of a swaying ladder further down the aisle. Smell of decaying paper and dried lavender sachets forgotten atop cabinets
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
