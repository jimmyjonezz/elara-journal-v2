Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at a table by the window, her hands wrapped around a cup of coffee, head inclined, eyes hidden beneath half-lowered eyelashes. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, a thin gold chain with a pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A caf√© bathed in soft early morning light. Outside the window, it's a rainy October day, city sounds are muted, and the air is filled with the scent of wet asphalt and roasted chestnuts.

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Artistic style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, subdued earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
