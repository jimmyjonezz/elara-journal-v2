Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Her fingers are curled around the edge of the desk, as she leans forward slightly, her eyes fixed on the page. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, with only a single desk lamp illuminating the space, casting a warm glow on the cluttered desk and the old, worn-out armchair in the corner, the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane outside
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
