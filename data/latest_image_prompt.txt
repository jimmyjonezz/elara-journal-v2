Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She leans against the windowsill, fingers tracing the rough fresh paint, breath fogging the glass, body tense yet poised as if ready to turn away. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Dimly lit new apartment kitchenette at dusk, winter chill seeping through single-pane window; snowflakes cling outside on gray urban rooftops, faint coffee aroma mingles with lingering paint and distant chimney smoke
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
