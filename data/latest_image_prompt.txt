Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Standing by the window, fingers leaving faint prints on the cold glass, shoulders slightly hunched as if bracing against an unseen weight. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A dimly lit room in the late afternoon, snow falling softly outside, the faint scent of cold air seeping through the window frame, the wooden floor creaking underfoot with each small shift in weight
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
