Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits cross-legged on the floor, her hands cradling a warm cup of tea, eyes gazing out the frosty window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The interior is cozy, with soft, golden lighting and the scent of old wood and tea, while outside, the winter landscape stretches, frozen and silent, under the pale January sun
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
