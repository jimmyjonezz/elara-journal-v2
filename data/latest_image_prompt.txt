Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Curled up in the chair, knees to chest, head bent over the notebook, hair falling like a veil. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Dimly lit room, old wooden floor creaking under the weight of memories, the scent of aged paper and faint traces of lavender from a dried bouquet in the corner. The clock on the wall ticks away the seconds, as the evening sun casts long, dancing shadows through the window
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
