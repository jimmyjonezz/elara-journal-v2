Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. sitting hunched over the closed laptop, fingers resting on the warm metal surface, shoulders slightly raised as if bracing against an invisible weight. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: dim afternoon light filtering through half-closed curtains, dust motes dancing in the stale air, the faint smell of old paper and cold coffee lingering on the desk
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
