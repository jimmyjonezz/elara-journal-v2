Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits curled on a worn armchair, knees drawn to her chest, forehead resting on her folded arms, one hand absently stroking the woolen blanket draped over her legs. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A small, dim room in late afternoon. Grey winter light filters through a single window, illuminating dust motes. The faint smell of old wool and cold plaster mixes with the distant, damp smell of wet asphalt from the street below. A low hum of a refrigerator can be heard from the kitchen
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
