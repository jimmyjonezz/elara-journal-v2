Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She stands dripping by the door, numb fingers unbuttoning her wet coat, towel clutched loosely in one hand, face flushed from wind and chill. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Dim interior of a cramped city apartment on a rainy late November afternoon; gray light seeps through streaked windows, patter of rain outside mixes with dripping water, air heavy with wet wool and faint cigarette smoke
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
