Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She grips the cold steering wheel with both hands, knuckles white, leaning slightly forward as if to push through the fog. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The interior of an old car, dashboard lights casting a dim glow on her face. Outside, thick fog obscures the road, headlights barely penetrating the milky haze. The air smells faintly of damp wool and old leather
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
