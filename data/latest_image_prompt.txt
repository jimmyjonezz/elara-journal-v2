Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits at the kitchen table, fingers resting on the unopened envelope, shoulders slightly hunched as if protecting something fragile. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Early evening light filters through lace curtains, casting a soft grid of shadows across the wooden table. The smell of cold coffee lingers in the air, mixing with the faint scent of old paper and dust. Outside, the first drops of rain tap gently against the windowpane
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
