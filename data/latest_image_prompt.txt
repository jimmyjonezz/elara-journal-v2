Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting in a wooden chair, her back straight, her hands resting on the table, fingers tapping lightly as if playing a piano. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A small study, dimly lit by a desk lamp, the window open just a crack, letting in the cool autumn air and the distant hum of the city. The scent of old books and dust fills the air, and the only other sound is the quiet ticking of a clock on the wall

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
