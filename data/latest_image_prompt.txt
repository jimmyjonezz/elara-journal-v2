Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Standing motionless under the downpour, face upturned to the rain, cold droplets tracing paths down neck and collar, fingers gripping a damp phone with hesitant resolve. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Dim urban alleyway at dusk, winter chill in the air, relentless rain drumming on pavement; scents of sodden earth and faint roasted chestnuts waft from afar, a lone candle-like streetlamp flickering unseen
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
