Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slumped in the seat, hands clutched around a worn-out book, eyes fixed on the passing lights outside the window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A dimly lit train carriage, filled with the hum of the tracks and the distant murmurs of other passengers. The scent of old paper and distant rain hangs in the air, as the train rumbles through the city at dusk

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
