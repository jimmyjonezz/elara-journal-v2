Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Her shoulders are hunched, hands clasped around a mug of tea that's gone cold, eyes fixed on the rain outside the window. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: Interior, dimly lit by a desk lamp, the only sound the soft patter of rain against the glass, the scent of old books and dust lingering in the air. Late afternoon, autumn

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
