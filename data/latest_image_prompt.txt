Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slumped against the window, forehead pressed against the cool glass, hands gripping the windowsill. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A small, cluttered apartment, dimly lit by the soft glow of an old lamp. The room is filled with the sound of raindrops tapping against the window and the distant hum of city traffic. The scent of old books and slightly burnt coffee lingers in the air

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
