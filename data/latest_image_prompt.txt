Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits with knees drawn up to her chest, arms wrapped around them, head resting on her knees, water dripping from her fingertips. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The bathroom is dim, lit only by the hallway light seeping through the slightly open door. Steam clings to the mirror, blurring the reflection. Outside, the city hums with distant traffic, and the faint scent of rain lingers in the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
