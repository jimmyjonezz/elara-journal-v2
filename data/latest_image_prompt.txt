Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits with her back straight, fingers clutching the letter, her eyes fixed on the words. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, with winter sunlight peeking through the blinds, casting a pale glow on the dusty floor, and the scent of old books wafts through the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
