Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at her desk, elbows on the table, head in her hands, fingers tangled in her hair. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A small, cluttered study, filled with the soft glow of an old desk lamp. The rain taps gently against the window, and the clock on the wall ticks away the seconds, marking the passage of time. The smell of old books and dust fills the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
