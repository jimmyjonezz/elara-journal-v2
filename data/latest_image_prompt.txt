Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She is sitting at the window, her elbows resting on the windowsill, her chin propped up on her hands, her eyes reflecting the rain outside. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: Soft, gray light filters through the window, casting shadows on her face. The room is quiet, except for the sound of raindrops hitting the window and the distant hum of the city. The air is cool and damp, smelling of wet earth and old books
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
