Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Sitting at a small wooden table, her hands wrapped around a mug, fingers tracing the rim, eyes fixed on the rain outside. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.

Setting: A cozy, dimly lit caf√© interior, with the scent of fresh coffee and old books, and the soft patter of raindrops against the windowpane

Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.

Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.

Art style: hyper-realistic painterly illustration, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
