Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. Slumped in the chair, elbows on the table, head resting on intertwined fingers, gaze fixed on the note. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: A small, cluttered apartment, late afternoon sunlight streaming through the open window, casting long shadows across the worn-out carpet, the faint scent of old books and coffee lingering in the air
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
