Character: A 24-year-old woman with long wavy brown hair casually gathered at the back. She sits with her notebook open, fingers tracing the empty lines as if searching for invisible words. She is wearing a white blouse with ruffles and a deep neckline, with a thin gold chain and pendant around her neck. Her expression is pensive, calm, with a hint of unresolved tension: her gaze is detached, lips slightly parted, cheeks lightly flushed.
Setting: The room is dimly lit, with a faint scent of old books and a hint of winter chill seeping through the window, the sound of rain pattering against the glass
Atmosphere: melancholic, intimate, timeless, filled with emotional nuances.
Key requirements: keep the character's appearance, clothing, and proportions absolutely unchanged; change only the background and surroundings.
Style: ultra-realistic painterly illustration with sharp 8K details, soft natural lighting, slight depth of field, muted earthy tones with "golden hour" accents.
